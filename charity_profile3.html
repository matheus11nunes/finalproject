        California Volunteers is a state-run initiative based in Sacramento that mobilizes
        residents to take part in civic action and volunteer programs that strengthen 
        California communities. Whether it's planting trees, responding to wildfires, or 
        supporting students in underfunded schools,California Volunteers harnesses the 
        power of people to create positive change.
        <span class="moreText" style="display: none;">
        The program works closely with AmeriCorps and other service-based organizations, 
        offering opportunities for both short-term volunteer projects and long-term 
        service commitments. It's a great platform for anyone in California looking to 
        step up and serve.
