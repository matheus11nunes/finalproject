    <p class="p-profile">
        Based in Little Rock, the Arkansas Foodbank is one of the stateâ€™s largest hunger-relief organizations,
        serving over 33 counties across central and southern Arkansas. Its mission is to provide nourishing food
        to people in need, and it does so by partnering with hundreds of pantries, shelters, and schools.
        <span class="moreText" style="display: none;">
            Volunteers play a vital role by sorting, packing, and distributing food donations that reach
            thousands of families each week. With a strong commitment to fighting food insecurity, the Arkansas
            Foodbank offers a hands-on way to make a real difference in local communities.
